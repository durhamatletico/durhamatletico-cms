# Durham Atletico

This is the Drupal 8 codebase for `https://www.durhamatletico.com`.

## Hosting

The site is hosted on Pantheon.

## Email

Email is handled via Mailgun although Drupal is not currently set up to use it.

## Tests

Automated testing is run through [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/durhamatletico/durhamatletico-cms).

To run tests locally, `tests/bin/behat -c tests/behat.yml`. You'll need to set up your own `behat.local.yml` first though.
